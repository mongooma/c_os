# 1.Of the four simulated algorithms, which algorithm is the “best” algorithm? 
# Which algorithm is best-suited for CPU-bound processes?  (long CPU bursts & short IO bursts)
# Which algorithm is best-suited for I/O-bound processes?  (short CPU bursts & long IO bursts)
# Support your answer by citing speciﬁc simulation results.
