		    *c+1 means exactly the same thing as c[0]+1, and is nothing special at all.
			*(c+1) means the same thing as c[1]. If you add one to the address of the beginning of an array, you get the address of the second thing in that array.

	3. notice that by ANSI C standard all the declarations must be placed at the top of the scope DONE
