Check to make sure that given an empty command, you don't error. Also maybe check that if given a pipe where one side is empty, you dont error

----

GOOD NEWS! We have replicate the error with getCmd() : when the data is not explicitly returned, there're some random behaviors - argv[0] will be re-written

current issues:
1. cat test.txt | more will cause an segmentation fault using valgrind
