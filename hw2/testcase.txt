current issues:


1. can only allocate 3 blocks of argv_user:
	(notice that within getCmd(), argv get allocated fine)

	passed:
	cat testcase.txt |  

	failed:
	cat testcase.txt | more --> cat be 0x0, | cannot access memory
	wc -l testcase.txt |  ---> wc be 0x0, | cannot access memory

	this issue is related to function pass by pointer
		try to find a way to check the memory maintained by the function and eny changes after it's returned
